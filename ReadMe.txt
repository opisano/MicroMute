MicroMute is a utility to toggle on/off the microphone under Windows by a single keystroke.

A friend of mine a a problem with his headphone-mike set not having a mute button. I proposed 
to create a simple tool to do this job for him on Windows. I used the scroll lock key, as it is 
almost never useful and as its state is associated to a LED or most keyboards.

This tool uses the audio API introduced in Windows Vista, so Vista or later is needed.
